FaceAuthGuard is an advanced facial recognition-based user authentication system. This project combines traditional username and password authentication with webcam-based facial recognition to enhance security by verifying user identities before granting access. The system is built using Python, OpenCV, Flask, MySQL, and machine learning algorithms.
